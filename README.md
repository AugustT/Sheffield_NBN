# Sheffield_NBN
Code generated for the Sheffield R user meeting 22/09/2015

For guidance on how to use rnbn for getting NBN data take a look at the demonstration script. This also covers how to create an interactive visualisation from the results. At the end of the demo script is a link to a shiny app built from the data.

The shiny app is also in this git repository and can be launched in R like this

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("Sheffield_NBN", "AugustT") 
```
You may need to install a few packages for this to work including googleVis, DT, lme4 and Matrix
